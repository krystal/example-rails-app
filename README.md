* Authie
* GitHub Actions for linting, testing and releasing
* Helm Charts

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide an example resource for those looking to create a new Rails application following the same practices that we use when developing our own applications at Krystal. We use have built a number of our own open source tools and use others and this repository brings them together.
